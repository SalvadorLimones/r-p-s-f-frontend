          <h3>*Rules*</h3>
          <p>
            This game is built on the well-known „rock, paper, scissors” game.
            The basics are the same – rock defeats scissors, scissors defeat
            paper, paper defeats rock. In every round, the one who wins earns
            one point.
          </p>
          <p>*</p>
          <p>
            But compared to the classical version of the game here you will find
            an extra feature: in every round, you have to pick one of the tools
            for your fellow player that s/he has to avoid in the next round.
          </p>
          <p>*</p>
          <p>
            If s/he – despite the „avoid” sign – chooses that item, you earn
            half a point in that round, no matter who wins the game.
          </p>
          <p>*</p>
          <h4> *The winner*</h4>
          <p>
            The winner is the player who has at least 5 points and at least 1
            point more than the other player.
          </p>
          <p>***</p>
          <h3>*Game types*</h3>
          <h4> *Championship*</h4>
          <p>
            In the Championship by clicking on Ready to Play! you will play with
            a random player who also clicked on the button.
          </p>
          <p>*</p>
          <p>
            Here you can compete with all the other registered players, you can
            check the results on the top list, which you can find by clicking on
            Championship in the menu.
          </p>
          <p>***</p>
          <h4>*Play with friends*</h4>
          <p>To play this version, you need to have Friends first.</p>
          <p>*</p>
          <p>
            By clicking on Friends in the menu you will see all the registered
            players and with the :) sign in the + column you can send a friend
            request to those you wish to.
          </p>
          <p>*</p>
          <p>
            The other player will notice your request in the Friend Status
            column, and if the feelings are mutual, by also clicking on the :)
            sign s/he can approve your request.
          </p>
          <p>*</p>
          <p>
            When you have at least one friend, go to the Playground (under the
            Friends menu), and choose which of your friends you wish to play
            with.
          </p>
          <p>*</p>
          <p>
            You can invite someone by clicking on the Invite button, and if you
            were invited to a friendly game, you can accept it with the Accept
            button.
